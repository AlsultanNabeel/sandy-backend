# Sandy

Sandy is an AI companion that lives inside a small robot. She hears your voice,
sees images, remembers your life, reads your mood, keeps your tasks and reminders,
does web research, writes code, and controls her own body (face, head, camera).
She runs on LangGraph with multi-agent function calling over Azure GPT-4o-mini,
and she stays online 24/7 on Heroku.

> Goal number one: a fast voice robot. You talk, Sandy understands, Sandy talks
> back, with almost no delay. Every decision in this project is measured against
> that goal.

## Two ways to reach Sandy

Same personality, same backend, same memory. Only the transport changes:

| Way | Status | How it reaches you |
|---|---|---|
| Telegram | Live (and we leave it as is) | Text and voice notes in the Telegram app |
| The robot | In progress | The ESP32-S3 streams audio over WebSocket, Sandy processes it and replies with voice from the device speaker, with almost no delay |

Why two: a Telegram voice note is a file (record, upload, download), so it can
never be real-time no matter how fast the backend is. The robot streams audio
live instead of sending files.

---

## What Sandy can do

| Feature | Details |
|---|---|
| Conversation | Text and voice, changing mood, short-term and long-term memory (MongoDB) |
| Voice | STT with Azure Speech. TTS with Gemini 3.1 Flash TTS first, then Google or Azure as fallback. Tone follows her mood |
| Tasks | Add, edit, complete, delete, priorities and projects. Stored in MongoDB, with a confirmation before anything destructive |
| Reminders | Create, edit, snooze, delete. Recurring (daily/weekly/monthly), linked to tasks, snooze buttons in Telegram |
| Life tracking | Shopping list (categories, price/qty memory, auto-linked to expenses), habits with streaks, expenses, journal, Bookly-style reading (author/category/star rating/format, notes & quotes, annual goal, streak & pages/day), and a Pomodoro focus mode bound to room scenes |
| Room scenes | Saved scenes (study, read, brainstorm, relax, movie, sleep, morning, off) drive a room node over MQTT — lights, color, music, fan, curtain — with optional timed reverts per action |
| Email (Gmail) | Read the inbox, send, reply, watch for important mail. Web inbox with actions: archive, turn into a task, Arabic summary, drafted replies |
| Research | News, places, and deep web research with Exa |
| Images | Generate and edit with Azure FLUX (DALL·E / gpt-image as fallback), plus image description with Vision |
| Documents | Read and analyze TXT, PDF, DOCX, CSV, XLSX, JSON |
| Memory | MongoDB plus an encrypted emotional long-term memory (Fernet) |
| GitHub | Read commits, issues, PRs, and files over MCP |
| Hardware | Control the face (25 moods), head, buzzer (6 melodies), and camera over MQTT, plus a separate room node (lights/color/music/fan/curtain) |
| Reports | Cost reports for Heroku, Azure, AWS, and Google Cloud |
| Project Builder | Build a whole feature or project in another repo after the owner approves (runs on the worker dyno) |

## Web app (React)

A bilingual (Arabic / English) React + Vite site. Same Sandy, same backend, in
the browser. It lives in its own git repo under `frontend/`.

- Pages: Home (an owner dashboard — quick-add, today's tasks/reminders/emails, plus reading/habits/spending/focus widgets and shortcuts; guests see a light welcome and the marketing lives on "Meet Sandy"), Studio (chat, search, and images, plus tabs for tasks, reminders, emails, focus, projects, my life, and the robot dashboard), Meet Sandy (voice, memory, timeline), Projects, Status, Privacy, Terms.
- Focus tab: start a Pomodoro (focus/break/cycles bound to a room scene), watch the live phase/cycle/time-left, edit room scenes (per-action device/value plus timed reverts), and pick the robot's melody for each focus event. My Life tab: shopping, habits, expenses, journal, and the Bookly-style reading view with per-book detail, notes, quotes, and the annual goal.
- Bilingual: an AR/EN toggle flips every string, the page direction (RTL/LTR), and the font (Cairo/Inter). Sandy answers in the active language. The site sends `lang` to `/api/agent` and `/api/analyze-image`, and she replies in that language with the same personality.
- Owner vs guest: the owner logs in for full access (real tasks, reminders, emails, and life data, plus the full pipeline). Guests see demo data in the productivity tabs and get a rate-limited Sandy with in-chat owner approval.
- Projects list: the Projects page reads the owner's GitHub repos and shows the ones tagged with the `sandy` topic that have Pages enabled, each as a live `iframe` preview. Projects that Sandy builds (repo plus `sandy` topic plus Pages, README stamped "Created by Sandy") show up here on their own.

## Voice pipeline

### Today (over Telegram)
```
voice note → download → Azure Speech STT → run_graph (LLM) → text right away
                                                           → TTS in the background: Gemini → Google → Azure → voice note
```
- `SANDY_VOICE_ENABLED=0` turns voice off (text only).
- The text reaches you right away. The audio follows on a separate thread, so the text is never held back.

### The road to low latency
1. Quick wins, keeping Telegram: cache the Gemini client and add timeouts, drop the extra summarization LLM call, fold routing from two LLM calls into one, stream STT instead of going through ffmpeg.
2. Real-time, the robot: ESP32-S3 to WebSocket (WSS) streaming plus a streaming speech-to-speech engine.
   - Recommended engine: Google Gemini Live API. Best Arabic and Levantine support, least friction (the project already uses `google-genai` and has a `GEMINI_API_KEY`), with built-in barge-in and tool calling.
   - OpenAI Realtime API is the documented fallback. Amazon Nova Sonic is not recommended (weak Arabic).

> Note: the old Nova attempt (`aws_nova_realtime.py`) was a broken placeholder, so it was deleted.

## Architecture

```
User message (Telegram: text or voice)
         ↓
api/webhook.py (Flask) or polling: dedup, instant 200 OK, hand off to a thread
         ↓
api/telegram_handlers.py: voice? → download → STT (Azure)
         ↓ text
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  agent/graph: run_graph()              │
│                                                        │
│  RouterAgent    classify category (chat/core/...)      │  (LLM call #1)
│  Specialist+FC  fc_router → function_call + mood       │  (LLM call #2)
│  soul_node      persona snippet + prefetch             │
│  router_node    pending? clarify? execute?             │
│      → execute / pending / clarify                     │  ToolDispatcher → Python or MCP
│  response_node  template + persona → final reply       │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ text
features/voice.py: text now, then TTS in the background (Gemini → Google → Azure)
         ↓
reply to user (text + voice)

  Web dyno ──(Mongo queue)── Worker dyno (Project Builder)
```

FC mode: every action is a tool registered in `ToolRegistry` (through
`setup.register_all_tools`) and run by `ToolDispatcher`. Adding a capability
means adding a tool, not editing the router.

## Humanization layer

| System | Role |
|---|---|
| Emotional LTM | Encrypted (Fernet) emotional memory. Remembers feelings and situations |
| Soul Vault | Persona snippets that change with mood (standard, empathetic, playful, formal) |
| Dreams Engine | Thoughts and notes that build up in the background |
| Interests / Style / Lessons / Relationships memory | Tracks interests, learns writing style, saves lessons and relationships |
| Health Monitor + Anomaly Detector | Tracks sleep and activity patterns and notices odd changes |

### Proactive features
- Proactive Comfort: reassurance on its own when a hard mood shows up.
- Proactive Context: daily notes plus accumulated context.
- Briefings: morning briefing, evening summary, and weekly stats land in Telegram on a schedule.
- Smart Silence: checks `SANDY_QUIET_HOURS` (default 23-7) before any proactive message.
- Multi-Tool Chain: "add a task for tomorrow and remind me at 10" runs `task_add` then `reminder_create` from one message.

---

## Project Builder (runs on the worker)

The sanctioned way to build a whole feature or project in another repo after the
owner approves:

```
Owner request → PLAN (Sonnet) → owner approval → build groups → PR
```

- 3 phases: PLAN (Sonnet writes structured JSON), Build (per-file content plus a strict validator), Finalize (wait_for_ci, then PR).
- Safety limits: 3 attempts per task, up to 200 KB per file, up to 30 files, up to 8 groups, an isolated branch.
- Graceful shutdown: if a Heroku redeploy lands mid-task, it checkpoints in MongoDB and the new worker picks up from the same point.

## Run locally

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd Sandy
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# create .env at the repo root. Minimum to boot:
#   TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN · OWNER_CHAT_ID · AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT · AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY · AZURE_OPENAI_CHAT_DEPLOYMENT
#   (everything else is optional. A missing key only disables its own feature.)

# the web process (the assistant you chat with). Use polling locally:
RUN_MODE=polling python cloud/sandy_agent.py

# the worker (optional, needs MONGO_URI + GITHUB_TOKEN + GITHUB_DEFAULT_REPO):
python cloud/sandy_worker.py
```
- The GitHub MCP server runs on Node 20.x (`@modelcontextprotocol/server-github`).

## Deploy to Heroku

```bash
heroku git:remote -a sandy-robot
heroku ps:scale web=1 worker=1 -a sandy-robot      # the worker needs Basic+ (Eco dynos sleep)
heroku config:set TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=... OWNER_CHAT_ID=... AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=... -a sandy-robot
heroku config:set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS_JSON="$(cat sandy-gcloud-key.json)" -a sandy-robot   # written to a file at boot
git push heroku main
```
- `Procfile`: `web: python cloud/sandy_agent.py` · `worker: python cloud/sandy_worker.py`
- Health: `GET /health`. Metrics: `GET /metrics` (Prometheus).
- In webhook mode: set `RUN_MODE=webhook` plus `APP_URL` / `HEROKU_APP_DEFAULT_DOMAIN_NAME`.

## The vision

Sandy is a small Jarvis. She understands you, remembers you, hears you, answers
in her own voice, sees images, does research, keeps your life in order, and moves
in the real world. Fast enough to feel like a conversation, not a command line.
