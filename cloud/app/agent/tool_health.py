"""In-memory health tracker for the FC tools (M6a).

Keeps a per-tool ring buffer of the last `_WINDOW` calls (success and
latency) so the rest of the agent can tell a registered-but-flaky tool
apart from one that doesn't exist, and warn the owner when a tool's
recent failure rate crosses `_DEGRADED_FAILURE_RATE`.

In-memory on purpose. It resets on dyno restart. A shared store would give us
cross-restart continuity but one restart flap would skew the numbers,
and what we want is whether the tool is flaky right now.

Every public function takes `_lock` because dispatcher callbacks can
fire from worker threads (sandy_executor), not just the main thread.
