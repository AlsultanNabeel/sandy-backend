"""Telegram message guards: in-memory dedup of Telegram retries.

The real cross-process / webhook dedup lives in `webhook.py`
(`webhook_seen_setnx` by update_id, in MongoDB). This module is just the
per-process safety net, and it's used in polling too. There used to be a
shared-store round-trip here as well, but it duplicated webhook.py and never
even looked at its own result, so it added hot-path latency for nothing.
Removed (B12).
